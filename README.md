# My-Module
This module is intended to make some tasks more practical, such as:
StringToNumber:
  Converts a string to a number by the most correct typing, example:
  '2.5' is a float number but in string. StringToNumber knows this string is a float number and automatically converts it to 2.5(Type Float).
  And if it was '2', the same thing, converts to 2(Type Int)
  
VerificaInt:
  Returns true if the number is Int.
  
Verificafloat:
  Returns true if the number is Float.

VerificaNumero:
  Checks if the variable is a type-independent number, if it is int or float.

AumentaPorc:
  Performs the operation to increase the variable by percentage.

DiminuiPorc:
  Performs the operation of decreasing the variable in percentage.
