# My-Module
This module is intended to make some tasks more practical, such as:

StringToNumber:
  Converts a string to a number by the most correct typing, example:
  '2.5' is a float number but in string. StringToNumber knows this string is a float number and automatically converts it to 2.5(Type Float).
  And if it was '2', the same thing, converts to 2(Type Int)
  StringToNumber(arg1):
  arg1 = The variable that will be converted into a number
  
VerificaInt:
  Returns true if the number is Int.
  VerificaInt(arg1):
  arg1 = The variable to be checked
  
Verificafloat:
  Returns true if the number is Float.
  Verificafloat(arg1):
  arg1 = The variable to be checked

VerificaNumero:
  Checks if the variable is a type-independent number, if it is int or float.
  VerificaNumero(arg1):
  arg1 = The variable to be checked 

AumentaPorc:
  Performs the operation to increase the variable by percentage.
  AumentaPorc(arg1, arg2):
  arg1 = Variable that will increase in percentage
  arg2 = Percentage that will be used

DiminuiPorc:
  Performs the operation of decreasing the variable in percentage.
  DiminuiPorc(arg1, arg2):
  arg1 = Variable that will Decrease in percentage
  arg2 = Percentage that will be used
